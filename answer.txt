In a non-Agile project, the product manager is equivalent to the product owner. The product owner is essential, as that person is the intersection between
the business team and the development team. The product owner gives the team direction and priority. 

The product owner and scrum master will be communicating a lot together. The Scrum master is responsible for facilitating the sprints and leading the 
stand up, sprint retro, and sprint planning meetings. The product owner's concern is business goals.

Sprint Retrospective: Discuss work done in the sprint, give feedback.
Sprint Planning: Determine tasks to complete in the next sprint, move stories from backlog to new sprint.
Standup: Discuss work completed yesterday, plan for the day, and bring up any concerns with team.
